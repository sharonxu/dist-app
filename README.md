Normal Distribution Shiny App
==============
Generate random normal distributions with your choice of mean, standard deviation, and sample size.

Easiest way to run the app:

```
library(shiny)
runGitHub("hospital-app", "sharxist")
```
Alternatively, you can clone the git repository, go to that directory, and use runApp():
```
setwd(~/hospital-app)
runApp()
```
